<!-- l. 3 --><p class='noindent'>In HWS2023 and FSS2024, we held a weekly reading group to work through the proof of the
classification of simple Lie groups. Famously, there is a complete classification: every simple Lie group
belongs to one of four infinite families or is one of five exceptions. What surprised us is that there was
no single book (that we found) who set itself the task of proving this result from the beginning in full.
The purpose of this seminar report is to consolidate our understanding by putting together our sources
into a single proof. We found that quite often the theorems were written with an eye towards
further developments. This was especially true for parts of the representation theory of
Lie algebras. We felt certain techniques were avoided or others emphasised because of the
role that they play e.g. in linear algebraic groups over finite fields. So a secondary aim is
to reduce the ideas to the simplest form necessary to prove the classification. We do not
intend to be fanatical; if an idea is clearer in its general form, so be it. Finally, we are
geometers and we do not try to hide our biases about what we find interesting or worth
exploring.
</p><!-- l. 14 --><p class='noindent'>We imagined audience of this report is ourselves one year ago. If we could send this through time a
year into the past, then it would have served as the main source for our reading group. We assume
therefore that a reader is a graduate student familiar with manifold theory but has never formally
studied Lie groups. Basic linear algebra is also a given.

        </p><blockquote class='quotation'>
     <!-- l. 26 --><p class='indent'>     The virtue of classification is that it provides a clear indication of the scope of
     examples in the subject. It is rarely a sound idea to prove a theorem by proving
     it case-by-case for all simple real Lie algebras. Instead the important thing about
     classification is the techniques that are involved. Techniques that are subtle enough
     to identify all the examples are probably subtle enough to help in investigating all
     semisimple Lie algebras simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
