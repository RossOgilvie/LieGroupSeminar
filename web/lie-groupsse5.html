inner products and Weyl reflections.

</p><!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>From <a class='url' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_form'><span class='cmtt-10x-x-109'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_form</span></a> there seems to be a close connection between
the Killing form and decompositions of Lie algebras: </p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'>On a simple Lie algebra any invariant symmetric bilinear form is a scalar multiple of the
     Killing form.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>The Killing form is also invariant under automorphisms of the Lie algebra
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>The Cartan criterion states that a Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if the Killing form
     is non-degenerate.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>The Killing form of a nilpotent Lie algebra is identically zero.
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Ideals that intersect only trivially are orthogonal.</li></ul>

<h4 class='subsectionHead' id='cartan-subalgebra'><span class='titlemark'>5.1   </span> <a id='x6-200005.1'></a>Cartan subalgebra</h4>
<!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>A point of difficulty seems to be Cartan subalgebras. In fact there are several, somewhat incompatible
definitions in the literature (in different cases) to suit different circumstances. Hall takes the simplest
definition: a maximal commuting subalgebra of diagonalizable elements. This immediately gives you a
root space decomposition, commuting implies simultaneously diagonalizable. The existence is rather
easy too, but only because he begins with a real compact form for the complex semisimple
algebra. FH takes the same definition, but in Appendix D proves existence through regular
elements.
</p><!-- l. 36 --><p class='noindent'>Knapp takes a more principled approach, asking what we should require of a subalgebra to get a
decomposition like we see in the standard examples, p83. It takes the more general starting point of a
nilpotent subalgebra h. Not all of them lead to a really nice decomposition, but somehow maximal ones
do, and these we call Cartan subalgebras. The drawback is that we don‚Äôt have diagonalizability at the
start, so we have to work with generalised eigenspaces, see Prop 2.5 p88. Here too the existence relies
on regular elements Theorem 2.9.
</p><!-- l. 42 --><p class='noindent'>Knapp Chapter 4 comes back to Hall‚Äôs point: Cor 4.26 a compact Lie group has negative definite
Killing form. Prop 4.27, gives an argument for the converse!
</p><!-- l. 44 --><p class='noindent'>What drew me to Knapp though was the discussion of real simple Lie algebras. In particular, how
complex Lie algebras can arise from real ones. The two extremes are the split real form and the
compact real form. These are constructed explicitly Cor 6.10 and Thm 6.11, but they require
the root decomposition. Other real forms (and these ones too) are described by a Cartan
involution. It is a vector space sum on which the Killing form is resp pos and neg definite (6.26)
and the brackets are behaved (6.24). Perhaps this could be the basis of a direct proof of a
compact real form. After some googling, this was suggested by Cartan 1929 to simplify the
proof, and there‚Äôs a paper by Richardson (?) that carries it out. But it‚Äôs not as simple as it
sounds.
</p><!-- l. 54 --><p class='noindent'>Another thing to consider would be to only classify compact lie groups. This has the advantage that
then the compact real form is a natural part of the set-up. You get basically the same list at the end. It
has most of the features you want to consider. And then maybe you can carry the classification all the
way back to the level of real Lie groups, without so much of the messy involution stuff at the end. Go
deeper on compact Lie groups; apparently their universal covers are compact, you can understand the
quotient theory well. It does feel like a limitation, when we are so close to getting all complex
semisimple Lie algebras.
