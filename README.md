# Lie Groups Reading Group Write-Up

This is a document to organise and consolidate the reading we have done on Lie groups and algebras.


## Tex Style Conventions
- Each sentence should be on its own line
- Ross prefers \[...\] over $$...$$ for display math, and formatted so that the deliminators are on their own lines.
- Ross defaults to align and align* environments, although gather can sometimes be appropriate.
- Labels should be semantic eg lem:intro:name of lemma.
- Should settle on a style for giving citations on theorems.

## Workflow for Ross
- Work on a separate branch; Nicolas works on main
- Periodically merge that branch back to main
- Then recompile the website
- Swap back to your branch.
